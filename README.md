This is an example project to get hands on React (for the very first time ✨) and try Cognito integration w/ API Gateway in order to authorize an API.

# How to run

This is an early stage, but if you want to try it, clone this repo and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
And you can access [localhost on port `5173`](http://localhost:5173) to see the current state.
